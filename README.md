# Code - A - Day
> If start doing it every day, even if its not that good, at least its did.
- Abraham Lincoln

## Intro
So I've been thinking that I spend WAY too much time setting up (especially hardware), researching, thinking about new ideas, and thinking about how those things COULD work... that its hard for me to get going and just start working on it. This code a day is in effort to just force myself to write some code, ANY code, every day this year. I sure hope I can do it.

I'm kinda inspired by [Jerry Seinfeld](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret), [Spencer Nugent (Sketch-a-day)](https://www.youtube.com/user/sketchadaydotcom) as well as others who have done the "work on it every day" kind of thing and have had really good results (like any successful person ever). I'm not promising everything will be great. In fact, I can guarantee that most of it wont be worth reading, but that’s not really the point.

The point is, I want to get better. I want to see what interesting results I'll get. I want to see where I’m weak in technical ability and thought process.

Not all the code will be posted in this one repo. I may post other places, but I will put a description below of what/where the code was posted and what I did. Let me know of anything you'd like to see.
