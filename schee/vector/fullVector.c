Building a vector
==============================================
Attempt at building a vector arry in C from scratch.

== Requirements ==
- Should emulate the basics of vector in C++
- Keep generic for all data types
    + Keep pointers to pointers = Read the content from that pointer
- Handle large amounts of arrays
- Resizing options + Should be able to add/or multiply to grow/shrink
    + That way options can be kept for differnt use cases

== Required Functions ==
[x] - Initalize
[x] - Expand - Grow to a new size
[x] - Add items - Depending on data type? Double at first?
[ ] - Delete items - Delete/shift


== For Later ==
[ ] - Shrink - If less than half full, shrink by 1/4
[ ] - Handle other data types other than just stirngs



== Might as well make it like C++ vectors for consistancy ==
-- From http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/ --
Member functions
(constructor)
Construct vector (public member function )
(destructor)
Vector destructor (public member function )
operator=
Assign content (public member function )

Iterators:
[ ] - begin - Return iterator to beginning (public member function )
[ ] - end - Return iterator to end (public member function )
[ ] - rbegin - Return reverse iterator to reverse beginning (public member function )
[ ] - rend - Return reverse iterator to reverse end (public member function )
[ ] - cbegin - Return const_iterator to beginning (public member function )
[ ] - cend  - Return const_iterator to end (public member function )
[ ] - crbegin - Return const_reverse_iterator to reverse beginning (public member function )
[ ] - crend  - Return const_reverse_iterator to reverse end (public member function )

Capacity:
[ ] - size - Return size (public member function )
[ ] - max_size - Return maximum size (public member function )
[ ] - resize - Change size (public member function )
[ ] - capacity - Return size of allocated storage capacity (public member function )
[ ] - empty - Test whether vector is empty (public member function )
[ ] - reserve - Request a change in capacity (public member function )
[ ] - shrink_to_fit  - Shrink to fit (public member function )

Element access:
[ ] - operator[] - Access element (public member function )
[ ] - at - Access element (public member function )
[ ] - front - Access first element (public member function )
[ ] - back - Access last element (public member function )
[ ] - data  - Access data (public member function )

Modifiers:
[ ] - assign - Assign vector content (public member function )
[ ] - push_back - Add element at the end (public member function )
[ ] - pop_back - Delete last element (public member function )
[ ] - insert - Insert elements (public member function )
[ ] - erase - Erase elements (public member function )
[ ] - swap - Swap content (public member function )
[ ] - clear - Clear content (public member function )
[ ] - emplace  - Construct and insert element (public member function )
[ ] - emplace_back  - Construct and insert element at the end (public member function )

Allocator:
[ ] - get_allocator - Get allocator (public member function )

Non-member function overloads
relational operators - Relational operators for vector (function template )
[ ] - swap - Exchange contents of vectors (function template )

Template specializations
[ ] - vector<bool> - Vector of bool (class template specialization )

** End C++ Vector
